# Mobi Farm Navigation with Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This repository contains MATLAB code for developing a deep learning model to navigate a mobile robot. The project utilizes data from RGB-D cameras and LiDAR sensors to predict the robot's linear and angular velocities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB (latest version recommended)
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Computer Vision Toolbox
- Robotics System Toolbox
- Sensor Fusion and Tracking Toolbox

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project-name.git
```

### Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the `main.m` script in MATLAB:
```matlab
run main.m;
```
